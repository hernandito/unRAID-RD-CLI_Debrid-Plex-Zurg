# unRAID Implementation for a Debrid Setup w/ CLI_Debrid, Plex, Overseer, Rclone,Real-Debrid, and Zurg

The 3 files above come from https://github.com/debridmediamanager/zurg-testing. I have only ever so slightly modified/clarified the paths that point to the right place per my linked guide below. 

This is a VERY complex process. Please PRECISELY follow the guide here:

Please Note:
I am practically a newbie on this.... I am NOT an EXPERT!
